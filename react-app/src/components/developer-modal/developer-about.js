                    Matt is responsible for coding the Flying Fox page you're currently on.
                    Matt began coding in the early 2000s for middle school and
                    high school projects using HTML and CSS. Since then, he has upgraded his skills
                    to code in Javascript, Typescript, Python, Pandas, Flask, and
                    React/Redux while attending AppAcademy and beyond with mentorship.
                    Matt learned to skydive in May 2021 and has loved every second of it.
                    He currently pilots a Swift 3 wingsuit, after receiving coaching
                    from some of the best wingsuit pilots in the Pacific Northwest at
                    Skydive Kapowsin.
